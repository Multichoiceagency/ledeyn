                  Cotton is a soft, fluffy fiber that grows in a protective case, known as a boll, around the seeds of cotton plants. It is one of the most important natural fibers used in the textile industry and has been cultivated for thousands of years for its versatility, breathability, and comfort.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  Our cotton is sourced from sustainable farms, ensuring high-quality fibers that meet the needs of textile manufacturers around the world. We work closely with farmers to implement ethical farming practices, ensuring the production of premium cotton while supporting local communities and preserving the environment.

              <li>
                Cotton comes from plants in the genus <em>Gossypium</em>, primarily grown in tropical and subtropical regions.
              </li>
              <li>
                The major cotton-producing countries include the United States, China, India, Brazil, and Pakistan.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cotton plants require a warm climate, plenty of sunshine, and moderate rainfall. The plants are harvested once the bolls mature and split open, revealing the white fibers inside.

                <strong>Harvesting</strong>: Cotton is harvested either by hand or using machines, depending on the region.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ginning</strong>: After harvesting, the cotton fibers are separated from the seeds using a machine called a cotton gin. This process produces raw cotton (lint) and cottonseed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Spinning and Weaving</strong>: The lint is spun into yarn or thread, which is then woven or knitted into fabric.
